📘 Student Management API 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to build a RESTful Student Management API using Node.js and Express. The API performs basic operations such as retrieving students, calculating averages, filtering by branch, and more.

This project demonstrates:

REST API design

Route parameters

Array operations (map, filter, reduce)

Proper HTTP status handling

Clean backend structure

🚀 Implemented Routes Method Route Description GET /students/topper Returns student with highest CGPA GET /students/average Returns average CGPA of all students GET /students/count Returns total number of students GET /students/:id Returns student by ID GET /students/branch/:branchName Returns students from specific branch

http://localhost:3000/students/average
http://localhost:3000/students/count
http://localhost:3000/students/3
http://localhost:3000/students/branch/CSE
